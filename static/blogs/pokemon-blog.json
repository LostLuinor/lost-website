  "fullContent": "<h2>It Always Starts With One Question</h2><p>You boot up a new Pokémon game. Fresh save file. New region. New adventure.</p><p>And then it hits you.</p><p><em>\"So… who's my starter?\"</em></p><p>This single decision somehow feels way more important than it should. You know you'll catch hundreds of Pokémon later, but your starter? That one sticks with you.</p><h2>How Most of Us Actually Pick Our Starter (Be Honest)</h2><p>Let's not pretend this is some calculated strategic choice. Most players fall into one of these:</p><ul><li>\"Fire types look sick\" (always valid)</li><li>\"This one's cute\"</li><li>\"I already googled the final evolution\"</li><li>\"This guy carried me last time\"</li><li>\"My friend already called the other two\"</li></ul><p>And honestly? All of these reasons are completely fine.</p><h2>There Is No Wrong Starter</h2><p>This needs to be said louder for the people in the back.</p><p><strong>There is no objectively wrong starter Pokémon.</strong></p><p>Game Freak literally designs these games so you can beat the story with any starter. You're not gonna get stuck because you didn't pick the \"optimal\" one.</p><p>Pick what feels right. Pick what looks cool. Pick based on pure vibes.</p><pre><code>SHUT UP AND PICK THE FIRE TYPE</code></pre></blockquote><h2>Why Starters Are Emotional, Not Logical</h2><p>Your starter is with you from Route 1 all the way to the Pokémon League. They get overleveled. They clutch fights they probably shouldn't win. They faint at the absolute worst times.</p><p>They become part of your Pokémon identity.</p><p>Years later, you might forget half your team — but you'll always remember your starter.</p><h2>Building a Team: Meta vs Meaning</h2><p>Once the game opens up, the next question hits:</p><p><em>\"Okay so what should my actual team be?\"</em></p><p>This is where people split into two groups:</p><ul><li>Google \"best team for [game name]\"</li><li>Catch whatever looks cool</li></ul><p>Honestly? The best teams are somewhere in the middle.</p><h3>Type Coverage Matters (But Not That Much)</h3><p>Yeah, having decent type coverage helps. It sucks getting swept by a random Ice or Fairy gym.</p><p>But you don't need perfect coverage to have fun.</p><p>If you vibe with a Pokémon, you'll make it work. That's just how it goes.</p><h2>Every Team Has \"That Pokémon\"</h2><p>You know the one.</p><ul><li>Not the strongest stat-wise</li><li>Definitely not meta</li><li>But you refuse to box it</li></ul><p>That Pokémon earns its spot through clutch moments, not spreadsheets.</p><p>Every memorable team has at least one.</p><h2>Ultra Moon Was Something Else</h2><p>Some Pokémon games are good.</p><p>Some are memorable.</p><p>And then there's Pokémon Ultra Moon.</p><p>Alola just hit different. The Totem battles actually made you think. The vibe, the soundtrack, the story — everything clicked.</p><p>Ultra Moon especially nailed that sweet spot between challenge and fun without making Pokémon feel like competitive esports.</p><pre><code>LILLY'S MOM🛐🛐🛐</code></pre><h2>Let's Talk About Gengar</h2><p>Every trainer has that one Pokémon.</p><p>Mine? Gengar.</p><p>Fast. Ghost-type. Slightly unhinged. Absolutely perfect.</p><p>Gengar slots into basically any team and still feels special every time. Whether it's outspeeding threats, landing clutch Shadow Balls, or just vibing with maximum menace energy — it never gets old.</p><p>Some Pokémon are strong.</p><p>Some Pokémon have personality.</p><p>Gengar? Both.</p><h2>Switch Era Pokémon Just Hits Different</h2><p>Playing Pokémon on the Switch still feels kinda surreal.</p><p>Bigger worlds. Actual good graphics. Quality-of-life stuff that should've existed years ago. And yet — it's still Pokémon at its core.</p><p>You're still out here catching creatures, battling trainers, and getting emotionally attached to pixels.</p><p>Some things never change. And honestly? That's fine.</p><h2>Final Take: Just Play Your Way</h2><p>Don't let tier lists ruin your experience.</p><p>Don't feel bad for picking a starter just because it \"looks cool\".</p><p>Don't box your favorite Pokémon because some guide said it's not optimal.</p><p>The best Pokémon team isn't the one with perfect stats.</p><p>It's the one you actually remember years later.</p><p>Pick your starter. Build your team. Have fun.</p><p>That's literally the whole point.</p>",
